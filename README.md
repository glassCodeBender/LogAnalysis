# LogAnalysis

WINDOWS LOG ANALYSIS 

Invoke-SecurityCheck is a script I wrote in powershell to analyze log files and grab useful security info. 

I got bored while working on the powershell program so I probably won't work on it again until I have 
a new windows computer to do forensics on.

MAC OS LOG ANALYSIS

I put together a bunch of commandline code to do Mac OS analysis. I was going to put the commands into 
a Scala program, but I don't have time to write the code at the moment. 

Powershell is super easy so, after doing a ton of research on Mac OS event log analysis, I ended up
writing a program in Powershell to supplement a class project instead.
